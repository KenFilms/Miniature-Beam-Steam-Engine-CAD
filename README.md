# Mini Beam Steam Engine
This steam engine model was originally designed by Lutz Hielscher. I bought this model off eBay and then created the CAD model from my own measurements of this model. It is not a 100% accurate and does not contain all parts. I created it for the purpose of creating an educational video on YouTube. 

3D CAD drawings for YouTube demonstration video.
You will need [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/index.php) with [Assembly_4_Workbench](https://wiki.freecad.org/Assembly4_Workbench) installed to view CAD files.

This steam engine is featured in this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Y00JR4w22Pw).
